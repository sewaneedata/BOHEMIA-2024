## Problem Statement

We will analyze data collected by the Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa and examine the efficacy of bed nets as a means to reduce malaria cases in Kenya and Mozambique.

## INTRODUCTION

The Bohemia (Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa ) Project is a hub of six leading research institutes with the plan to administer Ivermectin ( a drug given to humans and livestocks to prevent parasitic diseases). Although Ivermectin does not kill Malaria parasites, it attacks mosquitoes when they bite us.

## THE PROBLEM

The world is not on track to achieve the goals proposed by WHO in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 (GTS), and the currently available tools are unlikely to suffice. 400,000 people still die from malaria each year making malaria one of the leading causes of child death. Vector control, the most effective way to fight Malaria is being challenged by widespread insecticide resistance, and mosquitoes that avoid insecticides in bednets.

## Current Preventative Measures of Malaria

**Bednets**
- Bed nets are coated with pyrethroids, an insecticide that destroys the nervous system of mosquitoes on contact.

## Proposed Solution

<div class='propsol'>
The five-year Bohemia project funded by Unitaid will conduct a clinical trial in different ecological and epidemiological settings in east and southern Africa, specifically Mozambique and Kenya. Ivermectin will be distributed in mass drug administration campaigns to humans and livestock in order to reduce mosquito populations that transmit malaria.

## Overview of Ivermectin 

**Structure**

<div class='subtext'>
- Semi-synthetic antiparasitic medication derived from avermectins, a compound isolated from the Streptomyces avermitilis bacteria .

## BOHEMIA Project Goals

-   Generate evidence on the impact of ivermectin MDA on malaria infection in humans, on mosquito populations, and on the environment, as well as on its safety and acceptability by communities.

-   Support policy and translation of ivermectin as a potential vector control strategy for malaria impact.

-   Engage generic drug manufacturers as key partners for malaria intervention.
