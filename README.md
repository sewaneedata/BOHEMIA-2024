# BOHEMIA-2024

## Introduction

We are working with BOHEMIA to assess the information on bed nets and find any possible relationships between the usage of bed nets and other factors. Our dataset is being provided by a clinical trial conducted by our client which has data on bed nets and malaria. The codes in this repository will be used to try and answer the following questions:

- Definitions of Bed Nets and information on Bed Nets including demographic information
- Correlations between bednet Ownership, Sufficiency, and Usage (OSU)
- Differences in bednet usage between V1 and V7 within the efficacy cohort
- Effects of environmental factors on bednet usage
- Effects of community usage on malaria data

## Datasets

We will be working with 10 datasets in total.

1. kenya_demography.csv : has demographic information on the sample population.
2. kenya_safety.csv : has information on usage of bed nets over 4 visits.
3. kenya_safety_new.csv: has information on usage of bed nets for people added in the survey after the initial visit (for kenya_demography). 
4. kenya_efficacy.csv : has information on the usage of bed nets for children aged 5-15 over 7 visits. And the visits are 2 weeks before kenya_safety visits.
5. kenya_healthecon_baseline.csv : has information on the ownership of bed nets.
6. kenya_healthecon_baseline_new.csv : has information on the ownership of bed nets for people added in  the survey after the initial visit (for kenya_demography)
7. healthecon_monthly.csv : has monthly information on the price of bed nets.
8. malaria_incidence : has information on malaria incidents over 7 visits for each cluster.
9. kenya_ae : has information on the adverse event symptoms.
10. weather : has information on the weather data for Kwale in 2022.
